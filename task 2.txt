Document and objects

Document Object 

•	The Browser Object Model contains objects that represent the current browser window or tab The topmost object in the bom is the  object representing the window or tab or an iframe sometimes Window object has properties like browser history  location and the device’s screen etc In case of multi tab browser a window object represents a single tab but some of its properties like innerHeight innerWidth and methods like resize will affect the whole browser window


•	When a web page is loaded the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page The document object represents the whole html document as a tree of Objects(HTML, HEAD, BODY, and other HTML tags) It is the root element that represents the html document

Window object 

•	 It is the top most object and outermost element of the object hierarchy 
Document object 
•	 Each HTML document that gets loaded into a window becomes a document object The document contains the contents of the page Using document object JavaScript can modify add and delete the html elements attributes css styles in the page
•	The window object represents a window tab containing a dom document where as document object is property of window object that points to the dom document loaded in that window
•	You can access a document object either using window document property or using document object directly as window is global object In the below example title is the property of document object
•	The other major difference is that both window object and document object have properties and methods Few method names are same in both objects but with different behavior. In the below example window open opens a new tab or window and document open creates a blank document within the window
Screen
•	Screen is the window property that holds information of browser screen It refers to screen object associated with that window object Used to display screen width, height, colorDepth, pixelDepth etc
•	Similar to document screen can be accessed either by window.screen or screen object directly Screen object doesn't have any methods as in window and document objects
